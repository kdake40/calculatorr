Sure, here's a basic documentation for the scientific calculator you've created:

## Scientific Calculator Documentation

The Scientific Calculator is a web-based tool designed to perform various mathematical calculations, including basic arithmetic operations, trigonometric functions, exponentiation, square roots, logarithms, and more. It provides a user-friendly interface with a range of buttons for input and interaction.

 Features

1. **Arithmetic Operations**: The calculator supports basic arithmetic operations such as addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), and division (/). You can input numerical values and perform calculations using these operators.

2. **Numeric Input**: Numeric values from 0 to 9 can be input using dedicated buttons. This makes data entry quick and easy.

3. **Clear (AC)**: The "AC" button allows you to clear the current input or calculation result, providing a convenient way to start fresh.

4. **Trigonometric Functions**: The calculator includes buttons for sine (sin), cosine (cos), and tangent (tan) functions. These trigonometric functions work with radians and can be used to perform trigonometric calculations.

5. **Square Root (âˆš)**: The square root button calculates the square root of the input value. It is particularly useful for finding the square root of a number.

6. **Exponentiation (^)**: The exponentiation button allows you to raise a number to a specified power. This feature is handy for performing exponentiation operations.

7. **Factorial (!)**: The factorial button calculates the factorial of a non-negative integer input. It's useful for calculating factorials in mathematical expressions.

8. **Logarithm (log)**: The logarithm button calculates the natural logarithm (base e) of the input value. It can be utilized for logarithmic calculations.

9. **Decimal Point (.)**: The decimal point button adds a decimal point to the input, allowing you to work with decimal numbers.

10. **Delete (Del)**: The delete button removes the last character from the input, helping you correct mistakes during data entry.

11. **Equals (=)**: The equals button computes and displays the result of the entered mathematical expression. It's used to perform the actual calculation.

12. **Keyboard Support**: The calculator also supports keyboard input. Numeric keys, operators, and the Enter key can be used to input and calculate expressions.

 User Interface

The user interface of the Scientific Calculator is designed to be intuitive and user-friendly. The calculator features a responsive design, ensuring compatibility with various devices and screen sizes. Circular buttons provide a modern touch, and their colors help differentiate different types of operations.

Glowing Calculator Name

The "Scientific Calculator" name at the top of the interface has a special effect. It has an orange color and a glowing animation, making it visually appealing and enhancing the user experience.

 Styling

The calculator is styled using Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) to achieve a clean and professional appearance. Colors, fonts, and button styles have been carefully chosen to enhance usability and aesthetics.

 Usage

1. Click the numeric buttons to enter values.
2. Use the operation buttons (+, -, *, /, etc.) for basic calculations.
3. Utilize the special function buttons (sin, cos, tan, sqrt, etc.) for scientific calculations.
4. Press the "AC" button to clear the input or result.
5. Use the "=" button to calculate the result of the expression.
6. If needed, input decimal numbers using the decimal point button.
7. Correct input mistakes using the "Del" button.
8. Keyboard input is also supported for convenience.

Conclusion

The Scientific Calculator provides a comprehensive set of features for performing mathematical calculations, from basic arithmetic to advanced scientific functions. Its user-friendly design and responsive interface make it suitable for both casual and professional use.

Note: This documentation provides a general overview of the calculator's features and usage. Depending on the actual implementation and future updates, specific details may vary.
